# Fine-Tuning Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) for NLP Classification Task (Work in Progress)

This program follows Michel Kana's tutorial on BERT implementation. The goal is to detect political ideologies in congressional debate transcripts from 2005. 

### Dataset

For this task, the Ideological Books Corpus (IBC) data set was used, which contains 4,062 sentences annotated for political ideology.

### Results

We tested the model in 20% of the data set and achieved an accuracy of 95.83%. The average F1-score for the three classes was 95.21%.
